//Background Info
Duration (year): 2013â€“2017
Country amount: 28 countries

//Other Observations
Dataset lacks complete coverage across all 5 years.
The number of years available per country is inconsistent, meaning some data points are missing.

//Topic 

Find the number of unique companies and their total carbon footprint PCF for each industry group, filtering for the most recent year in the database. The query should return three columns: industry_group, num_companies, and total_industry_footprint, with the last column being rounded to one decimal place. The results should be sorted by total_industry_footprint from highest to lowest values.

//KEY NOTES
1. Filter for the most recent year in the dataset.
	WHERE year=(SELECT MAX(year) FROM public.product_emissions)
2. return three columns
	industry_group,
	num_companies,
	total_industry_footprint*with the last column being rounded to one decimal place
3. the number of unique companies and their total carbon footprint PCF for each industry group
4. sorted by total_industry_footprint(DESC)

//SQL Query
SELECT  
	industry_group, 
	COUNT(DISTINCT company) AS num_companies,
	ROUND(SUM(carbon_footprint_pcf),1) AS total_industry_footprint
FROM public.product_emissions
WHERE year = (SELECT MAX(year) FROM public.product_emissions)
GROUP BY industry_group
ORDER BY total_industry_footprint DESC
